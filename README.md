# Brainfuck Interpreter, but efficient
This interpreter does only the most basic optimizations for the sake of speed, like replacing fprintf() with fputs() when applicable.

(aand this adds an install target in the makefile just in case you're too lazy to move it to your path directory by yourself)

Usage: ./brainfuck <filenm>
NOTE: do not use the ./ if you've "installed" it with make install

# Brainfuck Interpreter
This is a simple Brainfuck interpreter I built for my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/alexlugo) channel. My first BF video I wrote hello world in the esoteric language. This time around I wrote the language itself. Who knows what I'll do in my final entry in the Brainfuck trilogy??

## Use
I made this interpreter in like 40 minutes. It's under 70 lines of code and it only uses standard libraries in C. To build the project just run `make`.

You shouldn't have to install anything crazy to run
this program...it's just Brainfuck.

## Shameless Plugs
If you're here *not* because of my YouTube channel, then here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/alexlugo) to it. Like share and subscribe, or whatever.
